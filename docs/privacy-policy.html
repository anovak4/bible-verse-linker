        <h1>Privacy Policy for Bible Verse Linker</h1>

        <p><b>Last Updated:</b> 7/1/2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Anna Novak ("I" or "me") handles information in connection with your use of the Bible Verse Linker Google Docsâ„¢ add-on (the "Add-on").</p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to me. I do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data or document content.</p>

        <h3>1. Information Accessed</h3>
        <p>For the Bible Verse Linker Add-on to function, it requires access to your open Google Document. Specifically, the Add-on will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the content of your active document: This is necessary to find text that matches Bible verse notations (e.g., "John 3:16").</li>
            <li>Modify the content of your active document: This is done to insert hyperlinks over the Bible verse notations it finds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This access is limited to the active document in which you run the Add-on. The Add-on does not have permission to access any other documents in your Google Drive&trade;.</p>
        <p>None of the content of your documents is stored. All processing of your document's text happens locally within your browser.</p>

        <h3>2. Use of Google's PropertiesService</h3>
        <p>The Add-on uses Google's built-in PropertiesService to save your preferences directly in your Google account, scoped to this Add-on only. This is used to remember your settings for a more convenient user experience. This data is stored by Google on your behalf. No personal data or document content is stored in this manner.</p>

        <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The Bible Verse Linker Add-on operates entirely within the Google Apps Script and Google Docs environment. Your use of Google's services is subject to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>. I am not responsible for Google's data collection practices.</p>

        <h3>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h3>5. Contact Me</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at <a href="mailto:bibleverselinker@gmail.com">bibleverselinker@gmail.com</a>.</p>
