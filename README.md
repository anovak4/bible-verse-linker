This will one day be an extension, but right now it's just a script. 
If you want to download the script and use it on your Google Docs here's how:
1. Go to https://script.google.com/home and create a new project.
2. Replace the default project code with the contents of linker.js.
3. I suggest renaming the project so you can find it again easier.
4. Inside the section to edit (lines 2-36), change the version acronym to your preferred version and paste in the link for the Doc. This link is just the general link in the address bar of the doc, not the sharing link. 
5. Click the "Run" button in the top menu. 
6. This will ask about permissions. The way the script works, it wants access to edit all your files. Since you're here on GitHub, I assume you've looked at the code and can see that all I do is look at the linked doc and add some links. If you want to use the script you will have to follow the advanced link on the safety warning page and tell Google you trust the script. 
7. Go look at your doc and all the nice links!
8. The new apps script shows up now in your main Google Drive. You can move it to any folder, so move it somewhere it'll be easy to find again.
